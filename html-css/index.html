          <h4>WEB DEVELOPMENT AS AN INDUSTRY</h4>
          <p>
            Welcome to the website. If you're here, you're likely looking to
            find random words. Random Word Generator is the perfect tool to help
            you do this. While this tool isn't a word creator, it is a word
            generator that will generate random words for a variety of
            activities or uses. Even better, it allows you to adjust the
            parameters of the random words to best fit your needs
          </p>
        </div>
        <div class="para2">
          <h2>PRACTICAL WEB DEVELOPMENT</h2>
          <p>
            The first option the tool allows you to adjust is the number of
            random words to be generated. You can choose as many or as few as
            you'd like. You also have the option of choosing words that only
            begin with a certain letter, only end with a certain letter or only
            begin and end with certain letters. If you leave these blank, the
            randomized words that appear will be from the complete list.
          </p>
          <p>
            Another option you have is choosing the number of syllables of the
            words or the word length of the randomized words. There are also
            ways to further refine these by choosing the "less than" or "greater
            than" options for both syllables and word length. Again, if you
            leave the space blank, the complete list of randomized words will be
            used. You have the option of choosing the types of words you want to
            be displayed using the "Word Type" dropdown. The default is "All"
            which is a curated list of thousands of the more common English
            words. You can also opt to only display nouns, verbs, or adjectives
            from this curated list. If you want to choose from all the words out
            there, you can choose "Extended" which is a list that includes over
            half a million different English words.
          </p>
          <p>
            If you're interested in random words in languages other than
            English, you can choose the "Non English" word type. Doing so will
            give you the option to generate words in ten different languages
            other than English. This includes Spanish words, Hindi words, Arabic
            words, German words, Russian words, Chinese words, Japanese words,
            Korean words. Latin words, or Italian words. You simply need to
            choose the language and then words from that language will randomly
            appear with each refresh of the page. Once you have input all of
            your specifications, all you have to do is to press the Generate
            Random Words button, and a list of random words will appear. Below
            are some of the common ways people use this tool.
